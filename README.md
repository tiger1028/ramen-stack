####React + Ampersand.js + MongoDB + Express + Node.js

RAMEN stack project stub/sample client-server app

### Purpose
Create a sample application to provide a framework for creating a web API in Node/Express/MongoDB with a corresponding SPA static client. These two applications could potentially be installed on separate servers with the web client only requiring a CDN type server to host the static HTML, CSS, JS files.

### Mentions
This stack is the product of two excellent tutorials.

The [Human Javascript](http://learn.humanjavascript.com/react-ampersand) video series by [Henrik Joreteg](https://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg) is responsible for the client side (SPA or Native Web App) architecture. It is an excellent tutorial and is well worth the purchase price.

The [Beer Locker](http://scottksmith.com/blog/2014/05/02/building-restful-apis-with-node/) tutorial series by [Scott Smith](http://scottksmith.com/) provided the foundation for the server side web API. It is also an excellent tutorial that provides an easy to follow intro to NodeJS, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose and Passport security.
